### 2. SplitText - Problem Statement  
**Component**: `<SplitText>`
- **Title**: Problem
- **Subtitle**: Disconnected frontline staff
- **Content**: Many of Workplace’s customers were large organizations with frontline staff, e.g., Walmart and McDonald’s. Frontline workers did not usually have work emails, and therefore could not register on Workplace to receive company updates. Communication leaders posted important news to Workplace, but frontline workers did not see it.

### 3. SplitText - Objectives
**Component**: `<SplitText>`
- **Title**: Objectives
- **Content**: In markets like Brazil, Facebook Messenger was already used by 40% of frontline workers informally to get updates about work. We thought that by integrating Workplace with Messenger we could enable comms leaders to reach more of their frontline. Our goals with the integration were to increase the engagement of Workplace with frontline users, and by extension, increase the reach of workplace communications within a customer company.
