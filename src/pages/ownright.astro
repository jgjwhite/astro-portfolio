  heroIntroContent="Ownright is a real estate law startup that provides legal closing services to buyers and sellers in Ontario. Customers pay a flat fee per transaction, and our revenue scales with the volume of deals we complete. I led design across Ownright's digital products, with a focus on our internal platform used by legal and support staff."

      title="Problem"
      content="When I joined, the legal team was using a mix of a Retool-built dashboard, third-party legal tools and spreadsheets to manage deals. These inefficiencies limited how many deals each of our legal and support staff could handle per month. We decided to build our own internal legal support tool, which consolidated fragmented workflows into a single interface, and I led the design from the ground up for it. Our KPI for this project was to increase the number of deals per support member per month that our team could handle (capacity) in order to unlock growth."

It was time-consuming, error-prone, and often deprioritized behind active closings since it was completed after deals were completed. I worked closely with legal to design a dedicated trust accounting workflow inside our internal tool."

I embedded our core design principles and heuristics into the system to align the team around best practices and the direction regarding how we wanted to shape our internal and external apps. Doing so helped increase alignment among the product team and, by extension, speed with which we could ship value to support."

One of the early opportunities for further research regarded the lingering question of who our ideal client profile was. We didn't have a lot of data to answer the question with beyond google reviews. I led an initiative to survey our past clients with targeted questions to help segment them into different behavioural patterns."
